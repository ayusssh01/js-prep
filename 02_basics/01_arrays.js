/*(1) JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types
(2) JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations  with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).
(3) A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a deep copy, in which the source and copy are completely independent.
(4) A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you can be assured you're not causing the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a shallow copy, in which changes to nested properties in the source or the copy may cause the other object to change too.*/
